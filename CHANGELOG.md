  worker for update.

## [1.131.2] - 2024-05-08
### Fixed

  timeout of 100ms. It prevents races when multiple files are uploaded at the

- Youtube returns a 401 response for videos that are not allowed to be embedded.
  These videos used to cause an error, now they are displayed as previews.

## [1.128.0] - 2024-03-01
### Fixed
- Fix lightbox for some old attachments that have no sizes in API responses.
### Added
- Drafts. When a user creates/edits a post or comment, the entered text is
  automatically saved to localStorage. This prevents accidental loss of content
  in case of a bad connection or browser closure. For posts, saved drafts also
  contain attachments and feed name information.

  Draft data automatically synchronized between the browser tabs, but not
  between the other user's devices.

  Drafts are deleted when a post/comment form has been successfully submitted or
  explicitly canceled by the user. When the user signs out, all draft data is
  deleted. Draft data also deletes when the signed in user changes.

  User can disable drafts saving on the Settings / Privacy page. In this case,
  drafts will still work, but will not be saved to persistent storage and will
  be lost on tab close/reload.
### Changed
- RTL texts are now right-aligned in the post bodies and in the user
  descriptions.

## [1.127.3] - 2024-02-14

  page.

## [1.127.2] - 2024-02-04
### Fixed
- Return the 'maximum-scale=1' back to the "viewport" meta tag, but remove it on
  non-iOS platforms. This allows to zoom in page on all platforms, but prevents
  the unwanted auto-zoom on iOS.

### Changed
- Upgrade React to v18
- Users can now scale the site with a pinch gesture on mobile devices.

## [1.126.0] - 2023-12-21

  commented on.

## [1.125.1] - 2023-11-24

## [1.125.0] - 2023-11-24
### Added
- The site administrator can now define a list of "privacy control groups" in
  the config (the _privacyControlGroups_ entry). These groups will be always
  shown in the feed selector of new or existing posts. The pages of such groups
  do not show posts by default, and such groups cannot be subscribed to.
- Support for the new "Notify of new comments" feature:
  - User can now turn on/off notification for new comments on the specific post
    via the "More" menu item;
  - User can now turn on/off notification for new comments on their own posts;
  - The new "Comments" tab has been added to the "Notifications" page.

  title. It has been moved to the "•••" menu on the right side of the list
  header.

  3.0.

### Fixed
- Reddit r/-links were displayed incorrectly.
- During direct message editing, there is no access check of the existing
  recipients (even if some of them are gone). This check is unnecessary because
  the message author cannot remove the existing recipients anyway.

## [1.123.3] - 2023-09-15
### Fixed
- The algorithm for displaying the "Expand" button in "compact" text mode has
  been fixed.

  `/groupname/f482e5#ad2b` (a comment).
  - All public URLs and links to posts and comments are now in short format.
  - Addresses of posts and comments with leading slash (`/user/...`) are now
    parses in texts as active links.
  - Old-fashion links, with long UIDs, are still fully supported.
- New page(s) `/:userName/:postId/backlinks` that displays posts that link to
  this post. This replaces the old way of displaying backlinks, which used
  search.

### Changed
- Spoiler tag can now contain line feeds. In addition, user text formatting
  utilizes simpler HTML, with fewer wrappers. Visually, the output for the user
  is not changed (except for line translations in spoilers).
- Text checkboxes are not processed in a special way if there is more than one
  of them in the text.

### Fixed
- The default font set no longer includes the Helvetica family when the client
  platform is Windows. Helvetica is not a native font in Windows, and the
  manually installed version of the font may be incomplete (for example, not
  contain Cyrillic).
- Updated TWEET_RE regex to support matching x.com in addition to twitter.com.

## [1.122.1] - 2023-08-10
### Changed

  traffic from them.

## [1.122.0] - 2023-07-31
### Added

  or "[x]" (one can use other symbols in parentheses as well: [v], [*], [🗸], or
  Russian "Ha").
  
  If the current user matches the author of the comment, an interactive checkbox
  is displayed at the beginning of the text. When the user clicks the checkbox,
  the comment text changes to reflect the checkbox state.

  For other users, a fixed-width text representation of the checkbox is shown:
  "[ ]" or "[🗸]".
### Fixed
- Telegram previews now supports dark theme

### Fixed

## [1.121] - 2023-07-15

  the "More" menu for comments/posts.
### Fixed

### Fixed
- Startup styles are applied only to the initial state of the page and do not
  interfere with application styles.

## [1.120] - 2023-06-14
### Changed
- The start script that initiates the configuration and sets the color scheme is
  now injected into the HTML code. The custom configuration is also injected
  using SSI, if possible. This allows instant access to the configuration,
  without an additional HTTP request, and allows the correct color scheme to be
  applied before the document body starts rendering. This, in turn, gets rid of
  the blinking when the page loads.
### Fixed
- Initial layout styles, to prevent jerking while loading
- Added support for legacy browsers, that doesn't support modern ES features

## [1.119] - 2023-06-02

  Mocha, Jest, and (mostly) Babel! Also:
  - 'lodash' replaced with 'lodash-es' for better tree shaking
  - Rare used pages, components and libraries now loaded asynchronously
- Multiple cosmetic corrections preparing the transition to Vite as a builder:
  - Use Dart Sass instead of node-sass
  - Use math.div instead of "/" in SCSS files
  - Rename files uses JSX syntax from .js to .jsx
  - Remove non-standard do {} syntax
  - Use explicit import() statements in the index.jsx
  - Use relative css imports for styles from node_modules
  - Update stylelint calls and fix styles issues
- The users and groups pages now shows dynamically calculated statistics.
- All "a" links without the "href" attribute and some other pseudo-buttons have
  been replaced by the ButtonLink component. This improves the keyboard
  accessibility of the site because ButtonLink is able to focus and click from
  the keyboard.
### Fixed
- The backlink click now doesn't reload a full page.
- On iOS, the feed selector doesn't focus properly after clicking the Add/Edit
  button.

### Changed

- The Dropzone library has been replaced with a custom file uploader.
  Attachments for posts and comments are now uploaded uniformly. The CreatePost
  and PostEditForm components have been redesigned to utilize the new uploader.
- The internal SubmittableTextarea component replaced by new SmartTextarea. The
  SmartTextarea allows to:
  - submit text by Enter of Ctrl/Cmd+Enter;
  - handle files paste and drag-n-drop;
  - insert text to the cursor position using 'insertText' instance method;
  - use 'onText' attribute to handle updated text (it is necessary for
    'insertText' updates, which doesn't trigger onChange).

  unclear reason we should 'color-scheme' CSS property for the iframe to make it

- The 'color-scheme' CSS property now applies on dark/light site mode. This

  will try to automatically determine whether it runs on desktop or mobile
  browser. User can manually select the submit mode, this setting will be saved

  old behaviour and shouldn't affect the existing users.

  have Mobile submit mode now.

### Added
- Generate '_dist/version.txt' file during production build. This file contains
  build version and date and can be used to auto-check the client updates.
- The client now can detect the updates of its code on the server and advice the
  user to reload the page. This feature is turned off by default. When enabled,
  the client makes a HEAD request every 5 minutes (configurable) to the specific
  address ("/version.txt" is recommended) and looks for the specific response header
  ("Last-Modified" by default). When the header value is changed, the information bar is
  shown to the user: “There’s a new update for FreeFeed available!
  _Refresh_the_page_ when you are ready.”
- Confirmation dialog when the private user wants to unsubscribe someone from
  himself.
- Donation 'traffic light' in the sidebar. This widget depends of
  `donations.statusAccount` config field (null by default means no widget). This
  field should contain the _username_ of the group (or user) whose _screenname_
  sets the donate status. The available statuses are 'Very good', 'Good', 'OK',
  'Very low', 'Low', 'Critical'. The widget performs case-independent search for
  these substrings in the screenname.
- Donation parameters (PayPal button ids, LiberaPay and YooMoney widgets) are
  now configurable by config.
- New mobile-friendly Sidebar and search-input

### Fixed
- When the user visits the post by non-canonical URL, the client replaces URL to

  query string and hash were not preserved.

  So when some content appears on the top of the page, it will not caused scroll
  compensation and will not be hidden under the top window edge.
- The info popups now shows properly for users that changed their usernames.
- The 'beta' cookie is now re-installed every time the application started. This
  is to trick Safari that deletes cookies after 7 days.

## [1.97.0] - 2021-03-18
### Fixed
- If the anonymous user visits the page that require authorization, the browser
  redirects to the `/signin?back=…` page. Previously, the back parameter
  included only the pathname of the page, not the query and hash. It is fixed,
  and now it includes pathname + query + hash. It is especially important for
  the magic links to the token creation page.
- The COMPLETE_POST_COMMENTS responses was not fully processed, leading to
  `Cannot read property 'username' of null` errors when updating comments.

### Added
- The 'Sign In' link in the header now has '?back=...' parameter that will
  redirect user back to the viewed page after sign in.

  by other methods.

  finished.
