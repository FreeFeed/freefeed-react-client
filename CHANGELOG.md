# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.127.0] - Not released

## [1.126.0] - 2023-12-21
### Added
- User can now turn on/off notifications for new comments on the posts they
  commented on.

## [1.125.1] - 2023-11-24
### Fixed
- Missing post submission form on group pages.

## [1.125.0] - 2023-11-24
### Added
- The site administrator can now define a list of "privacy control groups" in
  the config (the _privacyControlGroups_ entry). These groups will be always
  shown in the feed selector of new or existing posts. The pages of such groups
  do not show posts by default, and such groups cannot be subscribed to.
- Support for the new "Notify of new comments" feature:
  - User can now turn on/off notification for new comments on the specific post
    via the "More" menu item;
  - User can now turn on/off notification for new comments on their own posts;
  - The new "Comments" tab has been added to the "Notifications" page.
### Changed
- The wording "Disable blocked contingent..." (in the context of groups) has
  been replaced by "Show blocked content..." as more clear.

## [1.124.2] - 2023-10-25
### Fixed
- Checkboxes in texts was broken during the 'social-text-tokenizer' upgrade.

## [1.124.1] - 2023-10-11
### Fixed
- Some SASS issues.

## [1.124.0] - 2023-10-11
### Changed
- The feed selector ('To:' line) is now always visible in the post creation
  form.
- The "Edit list" link is no longer shown next to the Home or friend list page
  title. It has been moved to the "•••" menu on the right side of the list
  header.
- Upgrade 'social-text-tokenizer' (the post/comment texts parser) to the version
  3.0.

### Fixed
- Reddit r/-links were displayed incorrectly.
- During direct message editing, there is no access check of the existing
  recipients (even if some of them are gone). This check is unnecessary because
  the message author cannot remove the existing recipients anyway.

## [1.123.3] - 2023-09-15
### Fixed
- The algorithm for displaying the "Expand" button in "compact" text mode has
  been fixed.

## [1.123.2] - 2023-09-10
### Fixed
- Post actions didn't work on the post backlinks page.

## [1.123.1] - 2023-09-07
### Fixed
- The non-existent post page did not display the correct error message.

## [1.123.0] - 2023-09-05
### Added
- Links to posts and comments are now shorter: e.g. `/user/4a39b8` (a post) or
  `/groupname/f482e5#ad2b` (a comment).
  - All public URLs and links to posts and comments are now in short format.
  - Addresses of posts and comments with leading slash (`/user/...`) are now
    parses in texts as active links.
  - Old-fashion links, with long UIDs, are still fully supported.
- New page(s) `/:userName/:postId/backlinks` that displays posts that link to
  this post. This replaces the old way of displaying backlinks, which used
  search.

### Changed
- Spoiler tag can now contain line feeds. In addition, user text formatting
  utilizes simpler HTML, with fewer wrappers. Visually, the output for the user
  is not changed (except for line translations in spoilers).
- Text checkboxes are not processed in a special way if there is more than one
  of them in the text.

### Fixed
- The default font set no longer includes the Helvetica family when the client
  platform is Windows. Helvetica is not a native font in Windows, and the
  manually installed version of the font may be incomplete (for example, not
  contain Cyrillic).
- Updated TWEET_RE regex to support matching x.com in addition to twitter.com.

## [1.122.1] - 2023-08-10
### Changed
- Disable player for video attachments until we can deal with the increased
  traffic from them.

## [1.122.0] - 2023-07-31
### Added
- Comments can now be used as checklists if the comment text starts with "[ ]"
  or "[x]" (one can use other symbols in parentheses as well: [v], [*], [🗸], or
  Russian "Ha").
  
  If the current user matches the author of the comment, an interactive checkbox
  is displayed at the beginning of the text. When the user clicks the checkbox,
  the comment text changes to reflect the checkbox state.

  For other users, a fixed-width text representation of the checkbox is shown:
  "[ ]" or "[🗸]".
### Fixed
- Telegram previews now supports dark theme

## [1.121.1] - 2023-07-15
### Fixed
- Expand texts of translated posts/comments

## [1.121] - 2023-07-15
### Added
- Ability to translate the text of comments and posts (if supported by the
  server). Users can set their language for translation in the preferences (the
  browser language is used by default). There is a new "Translate to..." item in
  the "More" menu for comments/posts.
### Fixed
- User can now search for "My feed" in feeds selector
- Increased margin under the "Expand preview" button

## [1.120.2] - 2023-06-22
### Fixed
- Bookmarklet did not open
  - Bookmarklet component is now wrapped in Suspense because it is loaded
    dynamically
- UserSubscriptionEditPopup did not open when one clicked the 'edit' button
  - Fixed import of UserSubscriptionEditPopup component

    reference

## [1.120.1] - 2023-06-15
### Changed

### Fixed
- Startup styles are applied only to the initial state of the page and do not
  interfere with application styles.

## [1.120] - 2023-06-14
### Changed
- The start script that initiates the configuration and sets the color scheme is
  now injected into the HTML code. The custom configuration is also injected
  using SSI, if possible. This allows instant access to the configuration,
  without an additional HTTP request, and allows the correct color scheme to be
  applied before the document body starts rendering. This, in turn, gets rid of
  the blinking when the page loads.
### Fixed
- Initial layout styles, to prevent jerking while loading
- Added support for legacy browsers, that doesn't support modern ES features

## [1.119] - 2023-06-02
### Added
- Show the next comment in the same comment preview panel when clicking on the
  "^^" in the comment preview.
### Changed
- Use Vite as builder and Vitest as test runner. We no longer need Webpack,
  Mocha, Jest, and (mostly) Babel! Also:
  - 'lodash' replaced with 'lodash-es' for better tree shaking
  - Rare used pages, components and libraries now loaded asynchronously
- Multiple cosmetic corrections preparing the transition to Vite as a builder:
  - Use Dart Sass instead of node-sass
  - Use math.div instead of "/" in SCSS files
  - Rename files uses JSX syntax from .js to .jsx
  - Remove non-standard do {} syntax
  - Use explicit import() statements in the index.jsx
  - Use relative css imports for styles from node_modules
  - Update stylelint calls and fix styles issues
- The users and groups pages now shows dynamically calculated statistics.
- All "a" links without the "href" attribute and some other pseudo-buttons have
  been replaced by the ButtonLink component. This improves the keyboard
  accessibility of the site because ButtonLink is able to focus and click from
  the keyboard.
### Fixed
- The backlink click now doesn't reload a full page.
- On iOS, the feed selector doesn't focus properly after clicking the Add/Edit
  button.

## [1.118] - 2023-05-05

    incorrect keyboard layout is possible (English, Russian and Ukrainian

  created the post, or add their @username to the comment you have already started creating.
- Vimeo on demand links support
### Changed
- The Dropzone library has been replaced with a custom file uploader.
  Attachments for posts and comments are now uploaded uniformly. The CreatePost
  and PostEditForm components have been redesigned to utilize the new uploader.
- The internal SubmittableTextarea component replaced by new SmartTextarea. The
  SmartTextarea allows to:
  - submit text by Enter of Ctrl/Cmd+Enter;
  - handle files paste and drag-n-drop;
  - insert text to the cursor position using 'insertText' instance method;
  - use 'onText' attribute to handle updated text (it is necessary for
    'insertText' updates, which doesn't trigger onChange).

  This component handles all tasks related to creating/editing posts and
  comments in a unified way.

### Fixed

## [1.103.0] - 2021-11-12

  familiar syntax ^, ^^…, but starting from five caps these references now
  inserted as ^5, ^6 and so on.
- New appearance flag allows to use post/users hides not only in main Home feed,
  but also in Discussions, Everything, Best of… and user's friend lists pages.
  This flag is off by default.
- Support for cross-platform usernames, i.e. user@mokum, user@lj and so on. The

  textFormatter.foreignMentionServices in config/default.js).

  unclear reason we should 'color-scheme' CSS property for the iframe to make it
  background transparent again.
- Blur (un-focus) the ButtonLink conponent after the mouse click. This prevents

### Added
- The 'color-scheme' CSS property now applies on dark/light site mode. This
  property allows to set color scheme for browser UI elements such as scrollbars
  and form inputs.
- "Grips" in sidebar for drag and sort home feeds. Previously, the drag zone
  matched the feed link itself, and that was inconvenient, especially on mobile
  screens.
- "More" menu to posts
- There are two text submit modes now: the Mobile and the Desktop mode. The site
  will try to automatically determine whether it runs on desktop or mobile
  browser. User can manually select the submit mode, this setting will be saved
  in browser storage.
  - In Mobile mode, the Ctrl+Enter and Cmd+Enter acts as submit and Enter press
    caused line break.
  - In Desktop mode, the Enter press acts as submit, to insert a new line user
    should press Shift+Enter or Alt+Enter.
- Some frontend preferences defaults can now be overridden depending on the
  account's createdAt date. It is useful for the new defaults that breaks the
  old behaviour and shouldn't affect the existing users.

  have Mobile submit mode now.

### Added
- Generate '_dist/version.txt' file during production build. This file contains
  build version and date and can be used to auto-check the client updates.
- The client now can detect the updates of its code on the server and advice the
  user to reload the page. This feature is turned off by default. When enabled,
  the client makes a HEAD request every 5 minutes (configurable) to the specific
  address ("/version.txt" is recommended) and looks for the specific response header
  ("Last-Modified" by default). When the header value is changed, the information bar is
  shown to the user: “There’s a new update for FreeFeed available!
  _Refresh_the_page_ when you are ready.”
- Confirmation dialog when the private user wants to unsubscribe someone from
  himself.
- Donation 'traffic light' in the sidebar. This widget depends of
  `donations.statusAccount` config field (null by default means no widget). This
  field should contain the _username_ of the group (or user) whose _screenname_
  sets the donate status. The available statuses are 'Very good', 'Good', 'OK',
  'Very low', 'Low', 'Critical'. The widget performs case-independent search for
  these substrings in the screenname.
- Donation parameters (PayPal button ids, LiberaPay and YooMoney widgets) are
  now configurable by config.
- New mobile-friendly Sidebar and search-input

### Fixed
- When the user visits the post by non-canonical URL, the client replaces URL to
  canonical one, keeping the query string and hash if present. Previously the
  query string and hash were not preserved.
- The scroll compensation isn't applied now when the window scrollY position is 0.
  So when some content appears on the top of the page, it will not caused scroll
  compensation and will not be hidden under the top window edge.
- The info popups now shows properly for users that changed their usernames.
- The 'beta' cookie is now re-installed every time the application started. This
  is to trick Safari that deletes cookies after 7 days.

### Changed
- Removed old invalid links to Clio and "Archives F.A.Q."
- Post created by the user with 'Create post' from is showing with expanded
  comments. The user can add multiple comments to the newly created post and
  they will not be suddenly collapsed.

## [1.97.0] - 2021-03-18
### Fixed
- If the anonymous user visits the page that require authorization, the browser
  redirects to the `/signin?back=…` page. Previously, the back parameter
  included only the pathname of the page, not the query and hash. It is fixed,
  and now it includes pathname + query + hash. It is especially important for
  the magic links to the token creation page.
- The COMPLETE_POST_COMMENTS responses was not fully processed, leading to
  `Cannot read property 'username' of null` errors when updating comments.
- Tapping a user link was sometimes recognized as a mouse click on iOS devices.
- Make reducers compatible with offline state (they didn't know how to handle connectivity errors previously)

### Added
- The 'Sign In' link in the header now has '?back=...' parameter that will
  redirect user back to the viewed page after sign in.
- Forced page reloading after sign out. This guarantees a complete
  reinitialization of the state, which, unfortunately, is difficult to achieve
  by other methods.
