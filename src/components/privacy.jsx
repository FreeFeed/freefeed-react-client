        authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p className="legal-paragraph">
        8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal
        data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is
        unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our
        processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
        legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that
        objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your
        personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the
